Here’s a polished version of your **README.md** with additional details and the inclusion of icons. I’ve also formatted it to follow common conventions for a clean and professional presentation on GitHub.

# Password Strength Checker 🛡️🔑

This Python application checks the strength of a password based on its length, complexity, and whether it has been involved in a data breach.

## Features ⚡:
- **Checks password length**: Ensures the password is of sufficient length (minimum 8 characters).
- **Verifies password complexity**: Validates that the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
- **Checks against common passwords**: Detects common, easily guessable passwords like "123456", "password", etc.
- **Breach Check**: Uses the [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key) to check if the password has been involved in any known data breaches.
- **Real-time feedback**: Provides instant feedback on the strength of the password as you type.

## Installation 🛠️:
### 1. Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/sptemp-gpu/password-strength-checker.git


### 2. Navigate into the project folder:

- cd password-strength-checker


### 3. Set up a **virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv


### 4. Activate the virtual environment:
- On **Windows**:
  
- .\venv\Scripts\activate
  
- On **macOS/Linux**:
  
- source venv/bin/activate
  

### 5. Install dependencies:

- pip install -r requirements.txt


### 6. Run the application:

- python password_checker.py


## How it Works 🔍:
- **Password Length**: Ensures passwords are at least 8 characters long.
- **Password Complexity**: Checks if the password contains:
  - Uppercase letter
  - Lowercase letter
  - Digit
  - Special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
- **Common Passwords**: Compares the password against a list of commonly used and easily guessable passwords.
- **Breach Check**: The app uses the Have I Been Pwned API to check whether the password has been involved in any data breaches.

## Icons Used 🖼️:
- **Lock Icon**: ![Lock Icon](./icons/lock_icon.png)
- **Check Icon**: ![Check Icon](./icons/check_icon.png)
- **Warning Icon**: ![Warning Icon](./icons/warning_icon.png)


## Requirements 📦:
- Python 3.6+ 
- `requests` (for API calls)
- `tkinter` (for GUI)

To install these dependencies, run:

- pip install requests

### Changes/Improvements:
- **Icons**: I've added placeholder paths for icons (`lock_icon.png`, `check_icon.png`, and `warning_icon.png`). Ensure these icons are available in your project folder (`./icons/`).
- **Screenshots**: Add a screenshot of the app's interface (optional). You can capture it and place it in the `./screenshots/` folder.
- **More detailed installation and contribution instructions**: Cleanly formatted installation steps.
- **Icons**: I've included references for the icons used in the UI.
